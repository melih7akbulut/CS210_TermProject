Project Title:

Calorie Consumption Analysis

Project Description:

This project is a data science study that analyzes daily calorie consumption and examines seasonal trends. The data used in the project represents an individual's daily calorie intake and when this intake changes during different seasons. Additionally, it aims to visualize seasonal trends and predict future calorie consumption using machine learning models.

Project Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to help individuals better understand their daily calorie consumption. It also aims to assess the impact of seasonal factors on calorie intake and demonstrate how data science techniques can be used to predict future consumption.

Data:

The project uses data that includes individuals' daily calorie consumption. The data is stored in a CSV file and is used throughout the project.

Techniques Used:

Data Exploration and Analysis
Data Visualization
Machine Learning Models (SARIMA)

Code Overview:

Python programming language was used in the project. Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and statsmodels libraries were utilized for data analysis and modeling. The code can be found in the project's GitHub repository.

Usage Guide:

To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository.
Use the requirements.txt file to install the necessary dependencies.
Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE.
Execute the code step by step to observe the results.

Results and Visuals:

The project includes visuals such as line charts showing seasonal trends, learning curves, and prediction outcomes. These visuals support the project's findings.
